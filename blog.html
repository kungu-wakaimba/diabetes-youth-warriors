                <h2>How I Manage Diabetes as a College Student</h2>
                <div class="blog-meta">By <b>Emily Tran</b> &middot; May 2024</div>
                <p>
                    Being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 15 was overwhelming, but it really hit me when I left home for college. Suddenly, I was in charge of my own meals, schedule, and supplies. Here are a few lessons that helped me thrive:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin: 0 0 1em 1.1em; color: var(--text-secondary); font-size: 1em;">
                    <li><b>Planning ahead</b> for meals and always having healthy snacks on hand.</li>
                    <li>Using phone reminders for insulin and glucose monitoring.</li>
                    <li>Building a support circle by letting friends and my resident advisor know about my diabetes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Some days are harder than others, but I've learned that advocating for your own needs is a form of strength. If you're a student living with diabetes, remember that you're not alone—reach out, ask for help, and take care of your wellbeing.

                <h2>5 Everyday Habits That Improved My Blood Sugar Control</h2>
                <div class="blog-meta">By <b>Rajiv S.</b> &middot; April 2024</div>
                <p>
                    Managing Type 2 diabetes took time to figure out, but several simple habits made a big difference in my daily life:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin: 0 0 1em 1.1em; color: var(--text-secondary); font-size: 1em;">
                    <li>Checking my blood sugar at consistent times each day.</li>
                    <li>Eating regular, balanced meals and not skipping breakfast.</li>
                    <li>Walking for 20 minutes after dinner—it really works!</li>
                    <li>Learning how to read food labels.</li>
                    <li>Practicing mindful breathing to manage stress.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Progress isn't always fast, but small steps add up. Don't underestimate the power of routine, and remember—it's okay to ask family or friends to help keep you on track.
